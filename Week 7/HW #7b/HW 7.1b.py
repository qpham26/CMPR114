# This program simulates a simplified version of the game of Blackjack between two virtual players.
# The cards have the following values:
# - Numeric cards are assigned the value they have printed on them.
# - Jacks, queens, and kings are valued at 10.
# - Aces are valued at 1 or 11, depending on the playerâ€™s choice.
